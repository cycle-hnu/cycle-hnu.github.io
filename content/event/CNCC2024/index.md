abstract: 'As an important part of chip research and development, the compiler system is of great significance for supporting national strategic needs and improving software competitiveness. Its application in emerging technology fields including artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain, etc. is becoming more and more extensive. However, there is a relative shortage of practitioners in the field of compiler systems in China. The purpose of recommending this forum is to provide a platform for communication and cooperation for domestic scholars, researchers and engineers, and to promote interdisciplinary cooperation and communication by inviting practitioners in the field to share the latest research results, discuss technical problems, exchange experiences and ideas. At the same time, by discussing the application of compiler systems in cutting-edge fields, it will stimulate the innovative thinking of scholars and practitioners, promote the continuous progress and development of compiler system technology, and promote further innovation in related fields. The forum also hopes to promote the latest compiler system technology and applications to a wider audience, and promote its application and development in education, industry and social life.'
